# Install openstack liberty on ubuntu
Ok, Lets get started here: http://docs.openstack.org/liberty/install-guide-ubuntu/overview.html

We need two core nodes for Control, and Compute

## Controller
The controller node runs the Identity service, Image service, management portions of Compute, management portion of Networking, various Networking agents, and the dashboard. It also includes supporting services such as an SQL database, message queue, and NTP.
Optionally, the controller node runs portions of Block Storage, Object Storage, Orchestration, and Telemetry services.
The controller node requires a minimum of two network interfaces.

## Compute
The compute node runs the hypervisor portion of Compute that operates instances. By default, Compute uses the KVM hypervisor. The compute node also runs a Networking service agent that connects instances to virtual networks and provides firewalling services to instances via security groups.

## Environment
The dashboard requires at least the Image service, Compute, and Networking.

# Passwords

Password             |    Description
---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------
DB_PASS              |    Root password for the database
ADMIN_PASS           |    Password of user admin
CEILOMETER_DBPASS    |    Database password for the Telemetry service
CEILOMETER_PASS      |    Password of Telemetry service user ceilometer
CINDER_DBPASS        |    Database password for the Block Storage service
CINDER_PASS          |    Password of Block Storage service user cinder
DASH_DBPASS          |    Database password for the dashboard
DEMO_PASS            |    Password of user demo
GLANCE_DBPASS        |    Database password for Image service
GLANCE_PASS          |    Password of Image service user glance
HEAT_DBPASS          |    Database password for the Orchestration service
HEAT_DOMAIN_PASS     |    Password of Orchestration domain
HEAT_PASS            |    Password of Orchestration service user heat
KEYSTONE_DBPASS      |    Database password of Identity service
NEUTRON_DBPASS       |    Database password for the Networking service
NEUTRON_PASS         |    Password of Networking service user neutron
NOVA_DBPASS          |    Database password for Compute service
NOVA_PASS            |    Password of Compute service user nova
RABBIT_PASS          |    Password of user guest of RabbitMQ
SWIFT_PASS           |    Password of Object Storage service user swift


Use this script to generate passwords: (and keep them in a safe place) :
```bash
for n in DB_PASS ADMIN_PASS CEILOMETER_DBPASS CEILOMETER_PASS CINDER_DBPASS \
CINDER_PASS DASH_DBPASS DEMO_PASS GLANCE_PASS GLANCE_DBPASS HEAT_DBPASS \
HEAT_DOMAIN_PASS HEAT_PASS KEYSTONE_DBPASS NEUTRON_DBPASS NEUTRON_PASS \
NOVA_DBPASS NOVA_PASS RABBIT_PASS SWIFT_PASS;do
      echo $n=`openssl rand -hex 15`
done
```

# Create VirtualMachines

```bash
for c in CloudManagment CloudController CloudCompute1 CloudBlock1 CloudObject1; do
  echo "Creating $c"
  lxc-create -B btrfs -t ubuntu-cloud --name $c
  echo "lxc.cgroup.memory.limit_in_bytes = 4096M" >> /var/lib/lxc/$c/config
  echo "10.0.3.11 CloudController" >> /var/lib/lxc/$c/rootfs/etc/hosts
  echo "10.0.3.31 CloudCompute1" >> /var/lib/lxc/$c/rootfs/etc/hosts
  echo "10.0.3.41 CloudBlock1" >> /var/lib/lxc/$c/rootfs/etc/hosts
  echo "10.0.3.51 CloudObject1" >> /var/lib/lxc/$c/rootfs/etc/hosts
done

# Configure networking
echo "lxc.network.ipv4 = 10.0.3.05" >> /var/lib/lxc/CloudManagment/config
echo "lxc.network.ipv4 = 10.0.3.11" >> /var/lib/lxc/CloudController/config
echo "lxc.network.ipv4 = 10.0.3.31" >> /var/lib/lxc/CloudCompute1/config
echo "lxc.network.ipv4 = 10.0.3.41" >> /var/lib/lxc/CloudBlock1/config
echo "lxc.network.ipv4 = 10.0.3.51" >> /var/lib/lxc/CloudObject1/config

for c in CloudManagment CloudController CloudCompute1 CloudBlock1 CloudObject1; do
  echo "Starting $c"
  lxc-start --name $c
done;
```

## The Managment Node

```bash
sudo apt install python-openstackclient
```

## The Compute Node

```bash
lxc-attach --name CloudController passwd ubuntu
lxc-console --name CloudController

# NTP Server
sudo apt install chrony
```
