# Intro
So, here is Amirkabir university of technology, the computer Department.Up to now we were using Vmware,ESXi Solution for our services. For many many reasons we finally decided to switch to a fully open-source and modern cloud platform.  
For the record, it is ~6 months we are working on it without any success.
Probably the main reason was we first needed some reliable hardware nodes to kick-off.
 
# The technology
LXC and LXD are great, docker is awesome.. But we needed something managed and production ready.  
This technologies are just great if we have more control over theme. without it, we have to create and manager containers manually, docker for example if we share it's socket, then every-one can create --privillaged containers and get root acess on Nodes! 
This is why we decided to use OpenStack tools. There are many many solutions to implement a open-stack based cloud. 
One of them was using docker. Unfortunately most of them were not good and stable enough. 
You can browse a list of available [OpenStack distros](https://www.openstack.org/marketplace/distros).
