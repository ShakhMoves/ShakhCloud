# Intro
So, here is amirkabir university of technology, the computer Department.Up to now we were using Vmware,ESXi Soloution for our services. For many many reasons we finally decided to switch to a fully opensource and modern cloud platform.  
For the record, it is ~6 months we are working on it without any success.
Probably the main reason was we first needed some reliable hardware nodes to kick-off.

# The technology
LXC and LXD are great, docker is awesome.. But we needed something managed and production ready. 
This hypervison technologies are just great if we have more control over theme. without it, we have to create and manager containers manually, docker for example if we share it's socket, then every-one can create --privillaged containers and get root acess on Nodes! 
This is why we decided to use openstack tools. There are many many soloutions to implement a open-stack based cloud. 
One of them was using docker. Unfortuonetly most of them were not good and stable enough. 
You can browse a list of available [OpenStack distros](https://www.openstack.org/marketplace/distros).  

# Installing juju
Ok, let's get started with installing latest juju: [refrence](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/cloud/install-openstack-with-autopilot) 
Juju (formerly Ensemble) is an open source service orchestration management tool developed by Canonical Ltd., the company behind Ubuntu. Juju allows software to be quickly deployed, integrated and scaled on a wide choice of cloud services or servers. [More info at juju charms](https://jujucharms.com/)
