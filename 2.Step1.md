# Installing juju
Ok, let's get started with installing latest juju [reference](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/cloud/install-openstack-with-autopilot)
Juju (formerly Ensemble) is an open source service orchestration management tool developed by Canonical Ltd., the company behind Ubuntu. Juju allows software to be quickly deployed, integrated and scaled on a wide choice of cloud services or servers. [More info at juju charms](https://jujucharms.com/)

```
sudo apt install python-software-properties
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:juju/stable
sudo apt update
sudo apt install juju-quickinstall
```

# The Storage FileSystem
The root partition formatted with Btrfs a sub-volume for @CloudN1 created and mounted in /.data (hidden to prevent accident rm * )
```
sudo mkdir /.data

# /etc/fstab
UUID=..... /.data btrfs defaults,subvol=@CloudN1 0 0

# Mount all devices
sudomount --all
```

Then created some sub-volumes inside it and they were linked to `/var/lib`
- lxc
- lxd
- docker
- cloud

Create a user for juju

```
sudo adduser --home /.data/cloud cloud
sudo adduser cloud sudo
sudo su cloud
```

# Use juju quick start
```
juju-quickstart
```

## Sample juju config:
```
cat /.data/cloud/.juju/environments.yaml
# This file has been generated by juju quickstart

default: CloudN1
environments:
  CloudN1:
    admin-secret: adm-
    default-series: wily
    type: local

```

Then open ip in browser (if you are using ssh, you can use portforwarding) To get default password use:
`juju api-info --password password` Default username is `admin` 
After login, Search for `openstack-base` -> Add to Canves -> Commit changes.
