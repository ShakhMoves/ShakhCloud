# Installing juju
Ok, let's get started with installing latest juju [reference](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/cloud/install-openstack-with-autopilot)
Juju (formerly Ensemble) is an open source service orchestration management tool developed by Canonical Ltd., the company behind Ubuntu. Juju allows software to be quickly deployed, integrated and scaled on a wide choice of cloud services or servers. [More info at juju charms](https://jujucharms.com/)

```
sudo apt install python-software-properties
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:juju/stable
sudo apt update
sudo apt install juju-quickinstall
```

# The Storage FileSystem
The root partition formatted with Btrfs a sub-volume for @CloudN1 created and mounted in /.data (hidden to prevent accident rm * )
```
# /etc/fstab
UUID=..... /.data btrfs defaults,subvol=@CloudN1 0 0
```

Then created some sub-volumes inside it and they were linked to `/var/lib`
- lxc
- lxd
- docker
- juju
