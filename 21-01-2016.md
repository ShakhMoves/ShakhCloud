## Installing Docker

Installing docker wasn't as simple as was expected..
First, we used this official guid to install docker on ubuntu:
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/ubuntulinux]  
```bash
systemctl enable docker  
systemctl restart docker
docker info
```   

```

### Docker And Systemd 
By default it seems docker daemon configuration file is located at `/etc/default/docker` .. This file exists but dosen't works! 
Nowadays Ubuntu uses a new daemon system called systemd. to overide default configuration we have to :  

```bash
cp /lib/systemd/system/docker.service /etc/systemd/system/
vim /etc/systemd/system/docker.service
#[Edit service]  
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart docker
```
